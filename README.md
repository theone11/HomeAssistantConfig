# HomeAssistantConfig

This is my HomeAssistant configuration.

The main goal was to have the day-to-day activations and information always available/visible and everything else (like schedulers, history graphs) available upto 1-click away.

My main interface with the systen is via two wall mounted DIY 15.6 RaspberryPi based touchscreens. One on each floor.

You can take a glance at the functionality here (although not up-to-date):

The main goal was to have the day-2-day activations and information always available/visible and everything else (like schedulers, history graphs) available upto 1-click away.
