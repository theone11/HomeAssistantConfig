# My Home Assistant Configuration
## Overview
This is my HomeAssistant configuration.

The main goal was to have the day-to-day activations and information immediately visible and everything else (like schedulers, history graphs) available upto 1-click away.
My main interface with the systen is via two wall mounted DIY 15.6 RaspberryPi based touchscreens. One on each floor.

You can take a glance at the functionality in the below video (although not up-to-date):

[![Floorplan](ScreenShots/floorplan.png?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_AKHEyWXR0)

The UI is defined in the *lovelace_new_data.yaml* file.
Each section has a header and implements a different part of the UI.

All house images were created using SweetHome3D software and manipulated using GIMP image editing SW.
Two main floorplan images are the starting point:
* All lights OFF
* All light ON - from there each light ON image was created seperately

Only custom cards can be displayed on the UI so if an internal HA card need to be shown then a custom card template should be used as wrapper.
